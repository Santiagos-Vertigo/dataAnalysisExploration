Instructions:

Start by listing the files in the data folder and explain how to load them in Python.
Teach basic data cleaning techniques with code and explanations.
Show how to write reusable functions for cleaning.
Demonstrate automating the cleaning process for all files in the folder.
Summarize what was learned and suggest next steps for further automation or analysis.
